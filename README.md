Predictive Modeling for Heart Attack Risk

Description

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict heart attack risk using health data. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset includes features like age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more, sourced from [describe data source].

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed outliers using IQR, and encoded categorical variables.
Model Selection: Explored logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests for classification.
Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC were used to assess model performance.
Key Findings

Identified significant predictors of heart attack risk.
Achieved high accuracy and ROC AUC scores with [mention best-performing model].
Replication Instructions

To replicate the project locally:

Clone this repository.
Install required dependencies (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlalchemy, mysql.connector).
Download the dataset [include instructions to obtain the dataset].
